# MSBS-IRT-Chinese version
Boredom is a common negative emotional experience that humans universally encounter in their daily lives. Empirical research on the state of boredom holds significant importance. This study utilized the Chinese version of the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale and employed Item Response Theory to reduce the number of items. While maintaining its multidimensional structure, a simplified Chinese version suitable for experimental use was developed, resulting in a final version with 4 dimensions and 10 items. This version aims to facilitate empirical research on the emotion of boredom.


Previous research has often used methods like self-reporting and context-specific scales to measure boredom in participants. However, these approaches have limitations. The Multidimensional State Boredom Scale (MSBS) emerged in 2013 as a more stable method. It defines boredom as a negative state involving desires for satisfying activities, low/high arousal, attention deficits, and a slow perception of time. MSBS has five dimensions and 29 items.

Chinese scholars adapted MSBS, creating a 24-item Chinese version. However, due to its complexity, researchers have simplified MSBS in practical use, like using specific dimensions or fewer items.
This study aims to further streamline MSBS for experimental use while maintaining its core structure. This helps keep a consistent understanding and assessment of boredom.
